# fantasylineup
Code to optimize fantasy lineup with the ability for restrictions (currently for FanDuel). Essentially, this solves a variant of the knapsack problem. 

Code currently follows the FanDuel structure: D, K, WR, WR, WR, RB, RB, TE, QB


Need to add:

- Support for DraftKings style lineup and custom style lineups

- Custom restrictions (for example, running back and wide receiver cannot be on same team)
